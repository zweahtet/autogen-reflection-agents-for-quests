        "This notebook demonstrates a system for automatically generating and reviewing quests for characters using AI agents. It uses the AutoGen framework to define two main agents:\n",

        "**1. Quest Creator Agent:** This agent is responsible for creating quests based on input character details like backstory, interests, and focus. It leverages a large language model (LLM) from Groq's inference API to generate a quest description, objectives, steps, and rewards.\n",
        "\n",
        "**2. Reviewer Agent:** This agent evaluates the created quest based on criteria such as balance, coherence, and player engagement. It also uses a Groq LLM to provide feedback and either approves or suggests revisions.\n",

        "**1. Character Input:** The notebook defines a list of characters, each with relevant attributes.\n",
        "\n",
        "**2. Quest Creation:** For each character, a task is sent to the Quest Creator Agent to design a suitable quest.\n",
        "\n",
        "**3.Quest Review:** The generated quest is then sent to the Reviewer Agent for evaluation.\n",
